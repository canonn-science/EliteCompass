A simple compass example that allows you to enter a destination and it will automatically update the bearing towards that point.

Usage:
Extract and run the executable from pre-release-01.zip. Control + F9 toggles the display of the bearing (it will auto hide/show when you're within range of a body with lat/lon.

To add a heading (which is required for the bearing to work) press control+shift+F9 or right click on the system tray icon and select "Heading"

By default it will look for your journal file in the saved games directory of your user profile. Otherwise it will prompt for settings for you to browse for the directory for the journal.

Note:
This is only compatible with the Elite Dangerous Beyond Open Beta since it requires the status.json file

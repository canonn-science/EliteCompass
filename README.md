## Note: Beta Release 
This is only compatible with the Elite Dangerous Beyond Open Beta since it requires the status.json.

## Usage
Follow instructions in the latest release to install and run "Elite Compass.exe"

#### Display
The compass will display when you are on or near a body with a latitude/longitude position AND you have set a destination.

The compass will automatically hide when you are no longer near a body with latitude/longitude or you don't have a destination set.

Control + F9 toggles the display of the compass if you wish to hide it.

#### Adding a Destination
Control + Shift + F9 (or right click system tray icon and select "Set Destination")

Enter the latitude/longitude individually or type/paste it in the "Lat/Lng" textbox

## Settings
By default it will look for your journal file in the saved games directory of your user profile. 

Otherwise the settings dialog will open allowing you to browse and select the journal directory
